BUY AND SELL WEBSITE
=========

## ABOUT EASY LAPTOP FINDER(ELF)
Buy & Sell is a convenient destination for people to discover, buy and sell laptops. From the Feedpage, users can select to view listings. There is also a nice scroll at the top of the screen showing the most recent featured products.<br />
Users are able to filter their results by laptop price, size, Memory etc. and also filter by price, listing items from High to Low or Low to High.<br />
Users have the ability to add items to their favorites allowing them to come back at a later date when they are ready to purchase.<br />
If interested in an item users can message the seller. The negotiations can continue via the buyer and sellers personal email.<br />
Once an item has been sold the seller can go to their profiles page and mark an item as sold. A seller is able to:
- View active listings (includes marking an item as sold and deleting an active listing)
- View all listings (includes both active and sold items)
- Create a new listing

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
